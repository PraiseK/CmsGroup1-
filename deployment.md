This document outlines the development and deployment workflow for the Suite Contultants website. Follow these steps to successfully develop theme updates locally, test them, and deploy to staging and live sites.

## Project Overview

The Suite Consultants WordPress Website Development project, undertaken by Group 1, is a collaborative initiative to create a tailored WordPress website for Suite Consultants, a Netsuite consulting firm specializing in comprehensive solutions. Suite Consultants' core focus areas include sales, services, and support. The project's primary objective is to develop a modern and user-friendly online presence that aligns with Suite Consultants' business goals.

## Development Workflow

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine.

 -For feature development or editing/updating existing features, create a new branch in the repository, appropriately named for version control. Log new developments, edits, and updates on the Trello board as well as Slack. The Trello board serves as an effective project management tool and maintains a historical record of the project.

- Customize the theme in the relevant Integrated Development Environment (IDE), making version control commits. Push the completed work to the repository and create relevant pull requests to the main branch. Ensure that pull requests are tested before merging into the main branch.


### 2. Development and Commits

Make necessary changes to the codebase. Commit regularly with clear and concise messages.

 Once the main branch is merged and updated with changes, pull the repository to the local environment. Upload it as a zip file to the staging site through appearance/theme/add new and activate it to test on the staging website. After successful testing, upload the theme zip folder to the production site.

### 3. Push Changes

Push your branch to the remote repository.

### 4. Pull Request

Create a pull request on the GitHub repository. Assign reviewers and ensure that the changes pass code review.


## Testing Workflow

### 5. Local Testing

Before merging to the main branch, we tested the changes locally to ensure functionality.

## Deployment Workflow

### 6. Live Deployment: Website Hosting

when staging testing was successful, we deployed the changes to the live production environment. We used Pntheon as our hosting platform. Of all the other hosts we had considered it ended up being the winnig site because:
1. **Performance and Scaling:**
   - Pantheon ensures high performance and automatic scaling for handling varying levels of website traffic.

2. **Integrated Development Workflow:**
   - Offers a streamlined development process with version control integration and multiple environments (Dev, Test, Live).

3. **Security Features:**
   - Implements security best practices, automatic backups, and SSL management to enhance website security.

4. **Global CDN Integration:**
   - Improves website loading speed by integrating a Content Delivery Network (CDN).

5. **Scalable Hosting Plans:**
   - Provides hosting plans suitable for various needs, with dynamic resource scaling.

6. **Collaborative Tools:**
   - Includes team-based permissions and workflows to facilitate efficient collaboration among development teams.

7. **Support and Documentation:**
   - Offers support options and comprehensive documentation for troubleshooting and utilizing platform features.

It also provided us with a free hosted site that would be available the time we needed our website to be deployed.

## 7. Version Control
The utilization of GitHub's version control enables us to monitor, manage, and compare both old and new versions of the code committed by each team member to the repository. However, in this assignment, we have not employed GitHub version control until today. Instead, we incrementally updated the website and modified documentation files on GitHub as required. On the final day of submission, our plan is to convene and review any necessary changes to our existing work. We have allocated a single day to compile all our learning journal entries to submit the comprehensive file. 


### 8. Project Management
to facilitate effective communication, we used three platforms as well as a Github reprisotory to share all necessary documentation and more. To do so, we used:
1. WhatsApp- it proved to be an effective communication platform for group our collaboration due to its real-time messaging, widespread accessibility on mobile devices, and support for multimedia sharing. The group chat functionality facilitates discussions, while notifications and read receipts ensure prompt updates and acknowledgment. Additional options like voice and video calls offer versatility in communication methods which proved its effectiveness

2. [Trello](https://trello.com/b/4zz6bndF/cp3402-2023-group1) - The card-based system allowed for easy task tracking, assigning responsibilities, and progress monitoring. The intuitive drag-and-drop interface enhanced usability, making it accessible for all team members. Trello's real-time updates and notifications keep everyone informed about changes and developments within the project. The platform's flexibility accommodated various project structures, while its integration with other tools and platforms streamlines workflow. 

3. [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T06434CVC03/C063WHYJ2CW) - Although this was our least ued communication platform, it offered an intuitive chat interface which facilitates quick messaging and file sharing, promoting seamless communication among team members. The channel structure allows for organized discussions, while features like threads and mentions enhance clarity and engagement

4. [Github Repository](https://github.com/PraiseK/CmsGroup1-/edit/main)
GitHub repository served as a crucial platform for effective collaboration in the website development project. Its version control system allowed for meticulous tracking, management, and comparison of code changes made by individual team members. GitHub's branching and merging capabilities facilitated parallel development efforts, ensuring a streamlined workflow. The platform's issue tracking, pull request, and code review features contribute to a robust and collaborative development process.
